## Data Availability

Due to strict clinical governance and patient confidentiality, raw donor data and PDF-derived JSON files cannot be shared. This repository provides:

- complete preprocessing and modeling code
- full data schema from `json`
- synthetic example donors<br>

All experimental results reported in the paper were obtained using confidential hospital-internal data under approved protocols

## Overview

- Our work follows the DeepMind line of representation-first learning, where structure is learned prior to task supervision, and labels are used only to minimally align representations to downstream decisions under extreme data scarcity
- We learnt A SSL Donor Representation Encoder, and then use the binary transplantability classification (TX vs. NTX) to test

**Key Words**: Representation Learning, Data Scarcity, Self-supervised Learning

## Abstract

> LLM stands for Discrete Symbolic Model, but images / depth / point clouds / continuous signals are data in continuous space.<br>

> Forcibly tokenizing continuous space into LLM is incorrect from an information theory perspective. The traditional transformer can only deal with softmax(QKᵀ)V for the information output. <br>

> Fusion Transformer in latent-to-latent for ViT / other cv feature extractor to language tokens alignment. Use Continuous Encoder → Fake Token → Attention Trick to make LLM see the failure of continuous information but still effectively hack it.<br>

> It's like turning an image into 6 random tokens and telling the LLM, ‘This is image embedding, please pretend you understand it’. This is not multimodal understanding.<br>

<br>

> To address the above fundamental wrongness, we propose ★ Liver Predictor, a SSL model for liver transplantability prediction under extreme data scarcity.<br>
